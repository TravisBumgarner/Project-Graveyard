                <Text>There's a lot going on in the world right now and many of us are facing challenges we've never experienced before. Employees and students are going completely remote. Social events are being canceled. Medical centers are being overwhelmed. These events are the motivation for the Let's Pair Online Hackathon. Many of us find ourselves stranded in our homes with diverse skill sets, hoping to help and but are unsure of how to do so. This event will be a starting point for us to come together and contribute our skills to build a stronger community as we face a "new normal".</Text>

                    Problem: How can we engender the kind of spontaneous connection and collaboration that takes place in the office while everyone is remote working?

                        Create a virtual water cooler space that employees can join when they need a break. Co-workers can choose to be notified when a friend is at the water cooler.

                        Make a Slack integration that randomly pairs members in a channel and gives them a conversational prompt so people can connect with someone they might not otherwise have a chance to interact with and learn something about them

                    Problem: With fewer opportunities to get up and walk around employees could become less physically active. What could be done to encourage active, healthy habits when working from home?

                    <List.Item>Aggregate online exercise resources and create a tool that allows people to find and build an at-home fitness routine from multiple sources.</List.Item>
                    <List.Item>Build a dashboard that allows companies to set office-wide fitness goals. This could have a leaderboard and track individual as well as collective progress.</List.Item>
                    <List.Item>Create a Slack integration that lets people share their fitness goal to a channel and update when theyâ€™ve made progress on that goal. Creates a sense of accountability and channel members can encourage each other to stay on track.</List.Item>

                <Text>There are many professionals across the world focused on everything from medical aid to supply chain management. There are also other hackathons doing this as well. Perform a search for "COVID hackathon" and look at all the results. People are doing amazing work. That said - this hackathon is not focused on those issues. As noted by the tracks above, it's about how we maintain daily routines with ourselves and our communities throughout this time.</Text>
