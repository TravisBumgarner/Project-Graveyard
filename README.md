# Setup

1. Install Tampermonkey chrome extension (If you do this on another browser, toss me some instructions so I can add!)
2. Create a new script
3. Replace the entire contents of the file with the tampermonkey-headers.txt (the main point of this file is the regex line `@include /.*/` which will make this script work on all sites with a single video player per page) followed by the main.js code
